# webdriverIO_TDD
------------------------------------------------
End-to-end Roku tests using webdriver.io.

Boilerplate project to run WebdriverIO tests with Mocha using latest es2022 features and the page objects pattern.

Note: the current boilerplate uses an alpha version of the new WebdriverIO v8 version. As this version is not stable yet there might be some bugs. Checkout the v7 branch to see a version using a stable version.
